    "description": "Marvin was sold as a young buck after one breeding to a local breeder. He spent the next 6 years at two different farms north of me. when the opportunity to bring him back to the herd came up I lept at the chance. Marvin's dam Hyacinth was one of my best ever and his Sire \"Mikey\" the King of Pop had moved to TX. He is now an 8 year old and will live out his days here. This guy has earned many RGCH placings mostly behind another one of our bucks in live and virtual shows. He has milk production credentials from both dam and sire. Unfortunately, none of the breeders with his kids have milk tested his off spring. ",

    "description": "Sexy is a beautiful 6th generation buck. He is our Marvin replacement and of all the young bucks, he was all about mastering his new job! I had the pleasure (truly) of showing him in the May in the Motherlode show last spring. He was a complete little gentleman and convinced the judge to place him 1st in the Jr buck division, unfortunately the buck class was combined Jr/Sr and the Sr bucks won out for GCH and RGCH. We look forward to seeing his kids with Rosemary, Beryl Petite and Calamity this year. ",

    "description": "Purple Rain is my all time favorite goat. And I have had a lot of favorites! Her Dam Hyacinth was also a fave and in her own right earned finished Grand Champion. And my all time favotire photo of her on the right is just before winning her final champion leg. She was obviously communicating to Judge Amy \"PICK ME!\"\n\nPurple is now in an elite group of Mini Nubians, and likely Mini Dairy goats who has earned her FMCH and VMCH with MDGA and FGCH with TMGR. In most shows,  she rarely placed below Reserve.  A darling to milk she has earned her milk star multiple years. Big producer on kid front as well, kidding Quads as FF (one was DOA), quads her second, triplets as 3rd freshener and quads again as 4th freshener. Her kids from Mal  (a line breeding on Bravo and combination of two very strong milk/conformation lines) were stellar. That breeding will be repeated for 2022 kids. ",
