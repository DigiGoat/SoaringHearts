    "description": "So...I was downsizing...seriously downsizing the herd. And out of the blue I get asked if I am interested in this doe. A couple years ago we went out to take a look at a 1st gen mini nubian buck out of this doe because I absolutely LOVE her granddam on Sire's side. SGCH Thunder Ridge Willow 4\\*M. Willow was small in stature but oh so stunning, the smoothest most beautiful foreudder I had ever seen. She took my breath away. Lola's Dam is from a different line also out of My Enchanted Acres. I really bonded with Tallia too. I had the opportunity to hold her ringside at the 2015 ADGA Nationals in OR when her owner was showing Nigerians in the other ring. Tallia placed 8th in the very competitive and LARGE dry yearling class. Tallia went on to finish her GCH as well and became an 8\\*M doe. Lola's sister (dec.) was well on her way to doing the same, and was 9\\*M. We hope to help Lola live up to her potential.\nSo, I am pleased and honored to welcome Lola to the Soaring Heart's herd. Lola was bred for 2023 kids to Nigerian Stayawhile HC Forged Steel \\*B for 1st gen 50/50 kids. His dam is on the ADGA Elite Does list and has been ADGA top ten 3 years in a row. We are excited to add completely new genetics through this breeding. Her doeling from last year bred to Mal Maison is a stunning 1st gen 75% Nubian.  \n​\n*You can see more about Lola's Sire (My Enchanted Acres Rogue) here: https://www.swoonnubians.com/rogue*\n​\n*And more about Lola's Dam (GCH My Enchanted Acres Tallia 8*M) here: https://www.leisuretimedwarfs.com/nubians*",
