    "description": "Purple Rain is my all time favorite goat. And I have had a lot of favorites! Her Dam Hyacinth was also a fave and in her own right earned finished Grand Champion. And my all time favotire photo of her on the right is just before winning her final champion leg. She was obviously communicating to Judge Amy \"PICK ME!\"\n\nPurple is now in an elite group of Mini Nubians, and likely Mini Dairy goats who has earned her FMCH and VMCH with MDGA and FGCH with TMGR. In most shows,  she rarely placed below Reserve.  A darling to milk she has earned her milk star multiple years. Big producer on kid front as well, kidding Quads as FF (one was DOA), quads her second, triplets as 3rd freshener and quads again as 4th freshener. Her kids from Mal  (a line breeding on Bravo and combination of two very strong milk/conformation lines) were stellar. That breeding will be repeated for 2022 kids. ",

    "description": "Hillary is a sweet doe out of a special doe (1st Lady) who was the 1st after about 20 bucklings the year she was born. I had taken too many doeling reservations that year and had to sell Lady. She did not work out in the home she was originally placed in and my friend Annette took her for me until I could make arrangements to bring her home. In the meantime, we bred her at Annette's and the result was a stellar doe Seagal. Both Lady and Seagal went down to sunny CA to contribute to the budding Blackberry herd. I kept this doeling and she has done us proud. Hillary is a huge milker who is a dream on the milk stand and I count on her amazing milk late into the season for my morning coffee! ",

    "description": "Tundra exceeded our expectations in her first freshening earning her milk star through the MDGA rigorous one day test requirements. She is the first doe with blue eyes we brought into the herd. Tundra is funny and curious with excellent tasting milk (this has become a cull factor in our herd). I saw Tundra's grand dam at a local show and was quite impressed. She was beat in her class by the doe who went on to become the National Grand Champion at ADGA nationals 2019. It was for this reason I lept at the chance to pick her up along with her sister. Interesting that the sister was the one with spots, but dear plain Tundra has better udder. I have high hopes for that udder improving significantly in second freshening. "
