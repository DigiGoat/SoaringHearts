I took a short flight over to Idaho to see the Syringa Miniature Dairy goat Show in 2010 where I found my little unassuming buckling who became FMCH Echo Hill's Rio Bravo +*B the most significant addition to my herd in the 13 years I have been doing this. \nWith my friend \"Farm Boy\" Eric we tried a local 4H club show and took our little herd over to Walla Walla for our first Wine Country Classic MDGA show. That was 11 years ago. Soon I partnered with our local All breed goat club to sponsor MDGA sho0ws on this side of the state. WHAT A LOT OF WORK! I have empathy and respect for all folks who volunteer and run goat shows! For several years I chaired shows on both sides of the mountains. Here are some of the results of our live show career that is ongoing. Most of the judges we have placed under have been ADGA trained and licensed. \nThere are so few shows each year and coming to this late in life I am still, and always will be an amateur showwoman! And going forward will be both grateful for, and careful with my new titanium right shoulder! \n\n**2010 Wine Country Classic (WCC)**\n* All three rings GCH Mini Nubian Cascades Angelica\n\n**2012 Northwest All Breed Goat Club (NWABGC)**\n* Soaring Heart's Valerian GCH, RGCH X2\n* Soaring Heart's Angelica's Gift GCH, RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Chantilly Lace GCH\n* Soaring Heart's King of Pop GCH, RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Sassafras GCH\n* Soaring Heart's Rose Bonaparte RGCH\n\n**2012 WCC**\n* Soaring Heart's Rose Bonaparte GCH\n* Soaring Heart's Chantilly Lace GCH, RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Angelica's Gift RGCH\n\n**2013 NWABGC**\n* Soaring Heart's Chantilly Lace GCH\n* Soaring Heart's Hyacinth RGCH X2\n* Soaring Heart's Marvin Gaye RGCH\n* Lucky DISE Cinamon GCH, BIS, RGCH \n* Soaring Heart's Lady Masquerade GCH, RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Rose Bonaparte GCH X2, B IS\n* Soaring Heart's King of Pop GCH X3 BIS\n* Soaring Heart's Valerian RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Mickey Rooneie RGCH\n\n**2013 WCC**\n* Hidden Creek's Vision GCH X2, BIS x2, RGCH​\n* Soaring Heart's Marvin Gaye RGCH\n* Echo Hill's Lady Grace RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Sugar Pie RGCH\n\n**2014 NWABGC​**\n* Hidden Creek's Vision GCH X2​\n* Soaring Heart's Hyacinth GCH, BIS\n* Soaring Heart's First Lady RGCH\n* Echo Hill's Rio Bravo GCH X2\n* Soaring Heart's Root Beer RGCH X2​\n\n**2015 NWABGC​**\n* Soaring Heart's Hyacinth GCH, RGCH \n* Soaring Heart's Root Beer GCH X2, BIS\n* Soaring Heart's First Lady RGCH\n\n**2015 WCC *(112 decrees!)​***\n* Soaring Heart's Florence Nightengale GCH, BIS​\n* Soaring Heart's Hyacinth GCH, BIS\n* Soaring Heart's Esmee GCH \n* Soaring Heart's Will Smith GCH, RGCH\n\n**2016 WCC**\n* Soaring Heart's Florence Nightengale GCH , Best Udder RGCH​\n* Soaring Heart's Lil Red Corvette, RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Richard Sherman GCH, BIS, RGCH\n  Soaring Heart's Root Beer, GCH\n\n**2017 WCC**\n* Soaring Heart's Purple Rain GCH\n* Soaring Heart's Florence Nightengale GCH X2, RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Will Smith RGCH X2\n\n**2018 WCC​**\n    * Footloose Acres Pearl GCH and Best udder​\n    * Soaring Heart's Will Smith GCH\n    * Soaring Heart's Tolly Lace RGCH\n\n**2018 Oregon State Fair​**\n* Lucky DISE Ovie GCH​\n* Soaring Heart's Purple Rain RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Collateral Beauty RGCH\n\n**2019 WCC​**\n* Soaring Heart's Purple Rain GCH, Best Udder RGCH x2​\n* Soaring Heart's Will Smith GCH X3\n* Soaring Heart's Pink Cashmere GCH, RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Lavender Blue RGCH\n* Lucky DISE Goose RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Collateral Beauty GCH\n* Soaring Heart's Aaron Neville RGCH\n\n**2019 Pacific Northwest Summer Sensations**\n* Soaring Heart's Jasper GCH, BIS​\n* Soaring Heart's Jacob Black RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Tolly Lace GCH Best udder\n* Soaring Heart's Aaron NEville RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Lavender Blue RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's MArvin Gaye RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Purple Rain GCH, BIS, Best udder\n* Soaring Heart's Luther Vandross RGCH\n\n**2019 Oregon State Fair**\n* Footloose Acre's Pearl GCH, BIS Best udder​\n* Soaring Heart's Lavender Blue GCH, BIOS\n* Crooked Rooster Ranch Tundra RGCH\n\n**2021 PNWSS**\n* VMCH Soaring Heart's 1st Lady Hillary 2*P RGCH X2​\n* Soaring Heart's Beryl RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Sr Rosemary Donnely RGCH\n\n## Virtual Shows\nThe MDGA Virtual show is another avenue we have participated in occaisionally to suplement live show opportunities. This show really does rely on accurate well posed goat photos, and we are still not very good at those, although Leslie and I are getting better. Doing a lot of goats, most who do not care for the excersize is sometimes frustrating, often hilarious! We had many great placings nearly always having a goat in first place in at least one age group, here we will highlight only those animals earning GCH/RGCH or BIS and some of the shows are missing in the archives at MDGA.\n\n**Summer 2011**\n* Soaring Heart's Rose Bonaparte RGCH​\n* Soaring Heart's King of Pop GCH \n* Echo Hill's Rio Bravo RGCH\n* Summer 2015\n* Soaring Heart's Root Beer GCH​, BIS\n* Soaring Heart's Will Smith RGCH\n* Footloose Acre's Pearl RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Richard Sherman RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Hyacinth GCH, BIS and Best Udder\n* Soaring Heart's Florence Nightengale RGCH\n\n**Summer 2017**\n* Soaring Heart's Queen Latifah (now owned by Noriko Pruitt) GCH​\n\n**Summer 2018**\n* Soaring Heart's First Lady GCH x2 (owned by Duong's)​\n\n**Fall 2018**\n* Soaring Heart's Fritillaria RGCH​\n* Soaring Heart's Tolly Lace RGCH x2\n* Soaring Heart's Purple Rain GCH, BIS\n* Summer 2019\n* Soaring Heart's Marvin Gaye RGCH​\n* Summer 2020\n* Soaring Heart's Lavender Blue GCH X2​\n* Soaring Heart's Tahitian Pearl RGCH \n* VMCH Soaring Heart's 1st Lady Hillary GCH X2, BIS\n* Soaring Heart's I AM Legend GCH , BIS\n* Soaring Heart's Purple Rain RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Marvin Gaye RGCH\n\n**Fall 2020**\n* Soaring Heart's Tahitian Pearl GCH X2, BIS​\n* Footloose Acre's Pearl GCH, BIS\n* Crooked Rooster Ranch Tundra, RGCH\n* Soaring Heart's Purple Rain RGCH\n\n**Summer 2021​​**\n* FMCH, VMCH Soaring Heart's Purple Rain 2*P GCH X1​\n\n**Fall 2021​**\n* Soaring Heart's Lavender Blue GCH and Best Udder X1​\n* Soaring Heart's Sr. Rosemary Donnely RGCH X1"
