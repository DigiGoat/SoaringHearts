    "description": "Marvin was sold as a young buck after one breeding to a local breeder. He spent the next 6 years at two different farms north of me. when the opportunity to bring him back to the herd came up I lept at the chance. Marvin's dam Hyacinth was one of my best ever and his Sire \"Mikey\" the King of Pop had moved to TX. He is now an 8 year old and will live out his days here. This guy has earned many RGCH placings mostly behind another one of our bucks in live and virtual shows. He has milk production credentials from both dam and sire. Unfortunately, none of the breeders with his kids have milk tested his off spring. ",

    "description": "Sexy is a beautiful 6th generation buck. He is our Marvin replacement and of all the young bucks, he was all about mastering his new job! I had the pleasure (truly) of showing him in the May in the Motherlode show last spring. He was a complete little gentleman and convinced the judge to place him 1st in the Jr buck division, unfortunately the buck class was combined Jr/Sr and the Sr bucks won out for GCH and RGCH. We look forward to seeing his kids with Rosemary, Beryl Petite and Calamity this year. "
